## Decentralized Storage System
A blockchain-powered decentralized file storage platform that enables users to securely upload, store, and share files without relying on any centralized authority or single point of failure.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Decentralized Storage System is a blockchain-integrated storage platform designed to provide secure, tamper-proof, and highly available data storage using IPFS and smart contracts. Traditional cloud storage solutions depend on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to outages, hacks, single-point failures, and data manipulation.

This project overcomes these limitations by distributing data across a decentralized network using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) while using blockchain to ensure data integrity, user authentication, and secure file referencing. The system provides a Google-Drive-like experience but enhanced with transparency, immutability, encryption, and decentralized access control.

The deployed application allows users to upload files, share them with other wallet addresses, and retrieve data efficiently through the decentralized network.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Fully decentralized storage using IPFS.
- Blockchain-based data integrity and secure referencing.
- Encryption before upload for enhanced privacy.
- File sharing functionality using wallet addresses.
- High availability through distributed file replication.
- Frontend designed for seamless uploading, viewing, and access control.
- Trustless architecture — no centralized storage provider.

Note: Storage and retrieval depend on IPFS availability. If images do not load temporarily, it may be due to IPFS node delays or browser ad blockers.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The Decentralized Storage System demonstrates how blockchain and distributed networks can replace traditional centralized storage. By eliminating single points of failure and integrating cryptographic guarantees, the system ensures maximum privacy, transparency, and reliability.

This project serves as a foundation for real-world decentralized applications (dApps) requiring secure file storage, such as digital identity management, medical record systems, document verification platforms, and more.
